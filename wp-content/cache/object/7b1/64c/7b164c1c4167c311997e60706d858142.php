Autumn is the season of cosiness, so cuddle up underneath a soft blanket and read our 5 tips to go all-out on autumnal coziness.</h4>
<h3>1. Go green</h3>
Dark green is the accent colour this autumn. Bring nature inside with a few pretty plants or turn that one dull wall into a dark green accent wall. The options are endless!

<h3><strong>2. Velvet</strong></h3>
Nothing is more cosy to relax in than a big velvet couch. But you can also get that extra snug touch by adding a few small accents in velvet, a delightfully soft blanket or a few pillows for example.

<h3><strong>3. Create a warm &amp; cosy patio</strong></h3>
Sure, autumn usually comes with rain and cold temperatures. But that doesn't mean you have to hide inside until March comes around again. With a few comfortable pieces of outside furniture that can endure a bit of rough weather, a bunch of blankets and a fire pit or patio heater you'll be able to enjoy the autumnal evenings longer than you'd think!

<h3><strong>4. Go vintage</strong></h3>
Each year, new trends come and go (remember when everything was marble and bronze?) but you can never go wrong with vintage items. Take an autumnal trip to a garage sale or a secondhand shop and complete your interior with a few unique bits and pieces!

<h3><strong>5. Books as decoration</strong></h3>
Where in your home are your books? In one overloaded bookcase? In a messy pile next to your bed? Getting lost in different worlds isn't the only thing you can use books for. You can also use them to brighten up your home! Try sorting your books by colour or add little accessories to your bookcase.
